## Title : A Comparative study of Deep Reinforcement learning methods for Cryptocurrency Trading

Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable success across various applications. 
In light of this trend, the field of automated trading has developed a keen interest in leveraging 
AI techniques to forecast the future prices of financial assets. This interest stems from the need 
to address trading challenges posed by the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of asset prices. 
However, crafting a flawless strategy becomes a formidable task when dealing with assets characterized 
by intricate and ever-changing price dynamics. To surmount these formidable challenges, this research 
employs an innovative rule-based strategy approach to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). 
This application is carried out specifically in the context of trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP).
Our proposed approach hinges on the integration of Deep Q-Network, Double Deep Q-Network, Dueling 
Double Deep Q-learning networks, alongside the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms. Each of them aims 
to yield an optimal policy for our application. To evaluate the effectiveness of our 
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, we rely on portfolio wealth  and the trade signal as performance metrics. 
The experimental outcomes highlight that Duelling and Double Deep Q-Network outperformed when using Ripple (XRP) with the increasing of the portfolio wealth.
    

This project is part of the final project for the Reinforcement Learning course taught by Bilal Piot and Bobak Shahriari.


This project was done in collaboration with [Verlon Roel MBINGUI](https://github.com/VerlonRoelMBINGUI/RL_Final_Projects_AMMI2023), [Armandine Sorel Kouyim Meli](https://github.com/sorelkouyim), [Phanie Dianelle Negho](https://github.com/PhanieDianelle) and [Regis Konan Marcel Djaha](https://github.com/RegisKonan)  

####Dataset : The cryptoconcurrencies dataset used in this project is download on yfinance August 30, 2015 to August 30, 2023.
In this work, we use two kinds of assets: "BTC-USD" and "XRP-USD"
